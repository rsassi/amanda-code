		Release Notes for amanda-3.1.0

config
  * The 'rawtapedev' keyword was removed, and the 'label_new_tapes' keyword
    was deprecated.
  * New warnings for dangerous splitting configurations

changer
  We have many changers implementing the new changer API. The new changers are
  faster, more reliable, and have many new features.  One new features is that
  the changer keeps track of which label is in which slot, allowing it to
  locate a tape faster. But with some changers (new chg-multi or chg-robot
  without a barcode), it doesn't get automaticaly notified if you change the
  volume in a slot. In this case, you must notify the changer of it with the
  'amtape <conf> update' command:
    amtape DailySet1 update 3-8
    amtape DailySet1 update 3-8=
    amtape DailySet1 update 3=DailySet-003
  See amanda-changers(7) for more information.

ndmp, dvdrw
  New Amanda devices - see amanda-devices(7) for more information.

amsamba
  The default amandapass file for the amsamba application is
  $CONFIG_DIR/amandapass, but it is /etc/amandapass for program GNUTAR.
  Don't forget to move the file if you switch to the amsamba application.

ampgsql, amsuntar, amraw
  New applications to back up PostgreSQL databases, Solaris systems, and
  raw device files, respectively.

amtape
  Amtape's behavior has changed; see NEWS

amrmtape
  Rewritten with new command-line interface; see NEWS

amdevcheck
  New --label and --properties options give more information about device

amreport
  New, more natural command-line interface (try 'amreport $config')


		Release Notes for amanda-2.6.1

amgtar, amstar, amsamba, amzfs-sendrecv
  Three new programs implementing application-api.
  Swithching from the program "GNUTAR" to the application "amgtar" have some
  advantage:
   - amgtar use by default the gtar --atime-preserve=system option, you must
     disable it if you gtar relase doesn't have that option.
   - Can be configured to cross filesystem.
   - Can be configured to not check the device number on newer gtar
     (--no-check-device of gtar).
   - You can configure error message from gtar you don't want to see in the
     report.

amzfs-snapshot, script-email
  Two new scripts implementing script-api.
  The 'zfs-snapshot' script must be used only with the 'amgtar' application.

amarchiver
  New program to manipulate file in amanda archive format.

New perl Module:
  Application (perl utility functions for Applications)
  Archive (Perl access to the  amanda archive library)
  Constants (perl access to build-time configuration values)
  MainLoop (Perl interface to the Glib MainLoop)
  Process (interface to process), used by amcleanup.
  Script (perl utility functions for Scripts)
  Tapelist (Manipulate the Amanda tapelist)
  Xfer (Xfer-api)


		Release Notes for amanda-2.6.0

amcheckdump
  New program written entirely in perl, it replaces 'amverify' and
  'amveryfyrun'

amcryptsimple, amgpgcrypt
  New encryption plugins based on gpg.

amserverconfig, amaddclient
  New Initial Amanda configuration tools, these tools make assumptions,
   please see man page.

Deprecated programs
  'amverify' and 'amveryfyrun' are deprecated -- use amcheckdump.
  'amdd' and 'ammt' are also deprecated. If you have scripts that use
  them, then you must rewrite them in perl using the new perl modules.

Configure options
  --disable-shared doesn't work because perl modules require shared library.
  Instead, use --with-static-binaries to build staticailly linked binaries.
  --with-amlibdir, libraries are now installed in $amlibdir
    --without-amlibdir              : amlibdir=$libdir
    --with-amlibdir=yes             : amlibdir=$libdir/amanda  (default value)
    --with-amlibdir=/path/to/libdir : amlibdir=/path/to/libdir
  --with-amlibexecdir, internal programs are installed in $amlibexecdir
    --without-amlibexecdir                  : amlibdir=$libexecdir
    --with-amlibexecdir=yes                 : amlibdir=$libexecdir/amanda
                                                             (default value)
    --with-amlibexecdir=/path/to/libexecdir : amlibdir=/path/to/libexecdir
  --with-amperldir, Where to install perl modules
    --without-amperldir               : amperldir=$amlibdir/perl
    --with-amperldir=yes              : amperldir= $(perl installsitelib)
                                                                (default value)
    --with-amperldir=/path/to/perldir : amperldir=/path/to/perldir

Path changes
  Libraries are installed in $amlibdir (previously $libdir)
  Internal programs are installed in $amlibexecdir (previously $libexecdir)
  You must change your inetd/xinetd config for the new amandad path.
  The amandad path change affect rsh/ssh auth, amanda-2.6.0 installations
  will need to add an 'amandad_path' parameter to configuration files in
  order to talk to older versions of Amanda:
     amanda-2.6.0 client -> amanda-2.5.2 or earlier server: add
       'amandad_path "/usr/libexec/amandad"' (or the appropriate path) to
       /etc/amanda/amanda-client.conf
     amanda-2.5.2 or earlier client -> amanda-2.6.0 server: add
       'amandad_path "/usr/libexec/amanda/amandad"' (or the appropriate path)
       to /etc/amanda/amanda-client.conf
     amanda-2.6.0 server -> amanda-2.5.2 or earlier client: add
       'amandad_path "/usr/libexec/amandad"' (or the appropriate path) to the
       dumptype
     amanda-2.5.2 or earlier server -> amanda-2.6.0 client: add
       'amandad_path "/usr/libexec/amanda/amandad"' (or the appropriate path)
       to the dumptype
  The amandates files is now $localstatedir/amanda/amandates, previously it
  was /etc/amandates, this file must be created on all client.

usetimestamps
  It now defaults to 'yes'.

Glib
  glib is required to compile and run amanda.
  It is free and can be downloaded form http://www.gtk.org/download/

Device API
  The Device API is a complete rewrite of all tape-access functionality.
  To use the Device API, all devices must be specified by their full
  name, e.g., tape:/dev/nst0.  Existing functionality is now available
  in the tape, file, and rait devices, and a new Amazon S3 backend named
  's3' is also available.

Perl Module
  Link directly to Amanda, to support writing Amanda applications in Perl
  Available Modules:
    Changer (Execute changer scripts)
    Cmdline (Parse command line argument)
    Config (Parse config files)
    Device (device-api)
    Debug (Write to debug files)
    Logfile (Parse log files)
    Tapefile (Parse tapelist file)
  Perl modules are installed in $amperldir

local security driver (auth)
  Allows backups of the Amanda server without any need for network
  configuration, and similarly allows amrecover to work on the Amanda
  server without any network configuration.

make installcheck
  Almost 200 unit tests are available, which should be run on an installed
  copy of Amanda.  See http://wiki.zmanda.com/index.php/Testing for more
  information.

flush-threshold-dumped, flush-threshold-scheduled, taperflush
  These three config options allow to better fill your tapes.
  They are what was known as the taperstart/taperflush feature.


		Release Notes for amanda-2.5.2

IPv6

  IPv6 support is enabled by default if your OS support it, if your OS is
  not working correctly with IPV6, you can disable it at configure time
  with '--without-ipv6'.

readblocksize

  This option is useful only if you configured amanda with a big
  '--with-maxtapeblocksize' and your hardware can't works with big block
  size.
  

		Release Notes for amanda-2.5.1


usetimestamps

  This new feature will record all dump with timestamp instead of datestamp,
  it will allow to do many dump in a day and recover easily anyone of them.

  If you use this features, you will not be able to downgrade to 2.5.0 or
  earlier.

  see the usetimestamps section of 'man amanda.conf'


bsdudp/bsdtcp

  These are 2 new auth, they still use bsd authentification like bsd, but
  use less port.

  bsdudp is like bsd, it use udp for connecting to client but it will use
  only one tcp port for all data stream.

  bsdtcp use tcp to connect the to client and it's the only network
  connection use.  It doesn't have the udp packet size limit, so you can
  have an unlimited number of DLE for a single host.

amrecover use the security-api

  amrecover now use the security-api, You don't need to configure an
  amindexd and an amidxtaped services in your xinetd.
  amindexd and amidxtaped will be launched by amandad like any other services.
  You must do modification to your xinetd configuration and .amandahosts toi
  allow connection to amindexd and amidxtaped.

new format of xinetd.d/amanda

  amandad get in arguments the list of services it can launch, you must add
  theses services in the server_args options.

new format of .amandahosts

  You must append to each line the services this client can launch, the
  default is "amdump"


See the AUTHORIZATION section of the amanda man page and the
docs/howto-auth.txt
