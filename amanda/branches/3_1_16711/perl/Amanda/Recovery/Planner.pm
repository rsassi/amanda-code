Amanda::Recovery::Planner - use the catalog to plan recoveries

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $plan;

    $subs{'make_plan'} = make_cb(make_plan => sub {
	Amanda::Recovery::Planner::make_plan(
	    dumpspecs => [ $ds1, $ds2 ],
	    algorithm => $algo,
	    changer => $changer,
	    plan_cb => $subs{'plan_cb'});
    };

    $subs{'plan_cb'} = make_cb(plan_cb => sub {
	my ($err, $pl) = @_;
	die $err if $err;

	$plan = $pl;
	$subs{'start_next_dumpfile'}->();
    });

    $subs{'start_next_dumpfile'} = make_cb(start_next_dumpfile => sub {
	my $dump = $plan->shift_dump();
	if (!$dump) {
	    # .. all done!
	}

	print "recovering ", $dump->{'hostname'}, " ", $dump->{'diskname'}, "\n";
	$clerk->get_xfer_src( .. dump => $dump .. );
	# ..
    });

=head1 OVERVIEW

This package determines the optimal way to recover dump files from storage.
Its function is superficially fairly simple: given a collection of desired
dumpfiles, it returns a Plan to recover those dumpfiles, specifying exactly the
volumes and files that are needed, and the order in which they should be
accesed.

=head2 ALGORITHMS

Several algorithms will soon be available for selecting volumes when a dumpfile
appears in several places (e.g., from an amvault operation).  At the moment,
the algorithm argument should be omitted, as this will eventually indicate that
the user-configured algorithm should be applied.

=head2 INSTANTIATING A PLAN

For most purposes, you should call C<make_plan> with the desired dumpspecs, a
changer, and a callback:

    Amanda::Recovery::Planner::make_plan(
	dumpspecs => [ $ds1, $ds2, .. ],
	changer => $chg,
	plan_cb => $plan_cb);

As a shortcut, you may also specify a single dumpspec:

    Amanda::Recovery::Planner::make_plan(
	dumpspec => $ds,
	changer => $chg,
	plan_cb => $plan_cb);

Note that in this case, the resulting plan may contain more than one dump, if
the dumpspec was not unambiguous.

To select the planner algorithm, pass an C<algorithm> argument.  This argument
is currently ignored and should be omitted.  If the optional argument C<debug>
is given with a true value, then the Planner will log additional debug
information to the Amanda debug logs.  Debugging is automatically enabled if
the C<DEBUG_RECOVERY> configuration parameter is set to anything greater than
1.

The optional argument C<one_dump_per_part> will create a "no-reassembly" plan,
where each part appears as the only part in a unique dump.  The dump objects
will have the key C<single_part> set to 1.

The C<plan_cb> is called with two arguments:

    $plan_cb->($err, $plan);

If C<$err> is defined, it describes an error that occurred; otherwise, C<$plan>
is the generated plan, as described below.

Some algorithms may consult the changer's inventory to determine what volumes
are available.  It is because of this asynchronous operation that C<make_plan>
takes a callback instead of simply returning the plan.

=head3 Pre-defined Plans

In some cases, you already know exactly where the data is, and just need a
proper plan object to hand to L<Amanda::Recovery::Clerk>.  One such case is a
recovery from a holding file.  In this case, use C<make_plan> like this:

    Amanda::Recovery::Planner::make_plan(
	holding_file => $hf,
	dumpspec => $ds,
	plan_cb => $plan_cb);

This will create a plan to recover the data in C<$fh>.  The dumpspec is
optional, but if present will be used to verify that the holding file contains
the appropriate dump.

Similarly, if you have a list of label:fileno pairs to use, call C<make_plan>
like this:

    Amanda::Recovery::Planner::make_plan(
	filelist => [
	    $label => [ $filenum, $filenum, .. ],
	    $label => ..
	],
	dumpspec => $ds,
	plan_cb => $plan_cb);

This will verify the requested files against the catalog and the dumpspec, then
hand back a plan that essentially embodies C<filelist>.

Note that both of these functions will only create a single-dump plan.

=head2 PLANS

A Plan is a perl object describing the process for recovering zero or more
dumpfiles.  Its principal components are dumps, in order, that are to be
recovered, but the object presents some other interfaces that return useful
information about the plan.

The C<'dumps'> key holds the list of dumps, in the order they should be
performed.  Callers should shift dumps off this list to present to the Clerk.

To get a list of volumes that the plan requires, in order, use
C<get_volume_list>.  Each volume is represented as a hash:

  { label => 'DATA182', available => 1 }

where C<available> is false if the planner did not find this volume in the
changer.  Planners which do not consult the changer will have a false value for
C<available>.

Similarly, to get a list of holding files that the plan requires, in order, use
C<get_holding_file_list>.  Each file is represented as a string giving the
fully qualified pathname.
