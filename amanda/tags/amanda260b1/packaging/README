This directory contains scripts and data files necessary to build various binary
(or source) installation packages.  These are the currently functional packages:
	-Macintosh OS X >=10.4 .pkg files
	-RPMs for various OSes that use them.  TODO: Wiki page with a full
	 list of RPM using distros and versions the .spec supports.
	-Solaris .pkg files for 9,10
Coming soon:
	-ebuilds for Gentoo
	-.deb Debian style packages for various OSes that use them.
	-.msi packages for Windows XP and Server 2003 

The Directory layout is as follows:
packaging/
	common/		# Common files which can be shared by all packages such
			# License.txt, README, or Copyrights.  So far, empty :-)
	deb/		# Debian
	macosx-pkg/	# Macintosh OSX 
	msi/		# MicroSoft Installer for Windows
	rpm/		# RPM
	sun-pkg/	# Solaris .pkg 

Each subdirectory (except common) has a shell script named buildpkg.  This script will 
actually build the package with Zmanda's defaults for you.

See http://wiki.zmanda.com/index.php/Installation for more information.
