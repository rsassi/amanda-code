<refsect1><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>Amanda uses changers to arbitrate access to devices
(<citerefentry><refentrytitle>amanda-devices</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry>)
and data volumes.  Changers provide an abstraction of tape robots, but are used
to manage non-tape media, too.  Amanda communicates with changers through the
Changer API.  This manpage contains a <emphasis>user-level</emphasis> overview
of the API, and does not address details that are only of concern to
developers.  For that purpose, consult the Amanda source code and
http://wiki.zmanda.com.</para>

</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>TRANSITION</title>

<para>The Amanda Changer API is in transition from version 1.0 - driven by
shell scripts invoked for each changer operation - to version 2.0, composed of
perl objects that can manage parallel access to multiple devices and other
complexity.  When this transition is complete, Amanda devices will, in general,
be specified via a changer, which will provide the necessary device specifier
to access a requested volume.  In the interim, support for the "new" changer
syntax is limited to the experimental
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>amvault</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>.</para>

</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>SPECIFYING CHANGERS</title>

<para>Changer specifications are strings like
<computeroutput>chg-disk:/my/vtapes</computeroutput>.  The
<computeroutput>chg-</computeroutput> prefix serves to differentiate changers
from devices (see
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>amanda-devices</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry>).
The next portion (<computeroutput>disk</computeroutput>, in this case)
identifies the particular changer driver to use, and everything that follows
the <computeroutput>:</computeroutput> is interpreted by the driver.</para>

<para>A name which does not match this pattern, but which matches an old
changer script (e.g., <computeroutput>chg-zd-mtx</computeroutput>), invokes the
backward-compatibility changer driver as
<computeroutput>chg-compat:chg-zd-mtx</computeroutput>.  If the name does not
match an old changer, then it is treated as an Amanda device, and is wrapped by
the single-device changer, e.g.,
<computeroutput>chg-single:tape:/dev/rmt/0</computeroutput>.</para>

<para>Changers which require additional parameters can also be described in &amconf; with "changer" sections, for example,
<programlisting>
define changer hp-robot {
    tapedev "chg-robot:/dev/sg1"
    property "drives" "0=/dev/nst0;1=/dev/nst0"
    property "slots" "1-10"
}
</programlisting>

(note that "chg-robot" is not yet implemented, so this is hypothetical).  A
changer defininition creates a changer "alias", in this case named
<emphasis>hp-robot</emphasis>, which can then be named where an application
expects a changer - for example, the target of the <command>amvault</command> command.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>CHANGER DRIVERS</title>

<para>This section lists the changer drivers included with Amanda, and basic instructions for using them.  For complete How-To information, consult the Amanda wiki at http://wiki.zmanda.com.</para>

<refsect2><title>chg-disk (new)</title>
<programlisting>
tpchanger "chg-disk:/u01/vtapes"
</programlisting>

<para>This changer driver replaces the old <command>chg-disk</command>,
supporting parallel access to vtapes stored in directories named
<computeroutput>slotN</computeroutput> in the directory specified after
<computeroutput>chg-disk:</computeroutput>.  It does so by creating numbered
"drives" so that simultaneous processes can access distinct slots.</para>

</refsect2>

<refsect2><title>chg-disk (old)</title>
<programlisting>
tapedev "file:/u01/vtapes"
tpchanger "chg-disk"
</programlisting>

<para>This changer script supports sequential access to vtapes stored in
directories named <computeroutput>slotN</computeroutput> in the directory
specified by the <emphasis>tapedev</emphasis> parameter.</para>

</refsect2>

<refsect2><title>chg-multi</title>
<programlisting>
tpchanger "chg-multi"
changerfile "chg-multi-state"
</programlisting>

<para>This script simply round-robins a number of distinct device names, as
specified in its configuration file.  It is useful when all volumes for a
configuration have different device names -- for example, with S3 devices.
The <emphasis>changerfile</emphasis> need not exist; it is used as a prefix
for filenames of state files.
</para>

</refsect2>

<refsect2><title>chg-manual</title>
<programlisting>
tpchanger "chg-manual"
changerfile "chg-manual.conf"
</programlisting>

<para>This script simply provides distinct device names in a round-robin
fashion, as specified in its configuration file.  It is useful when all volumes
for a configuration have different device names -- for example, with S3
devices.  The configuration file parameters are (as listed in the script):
<programlisting>
resend_mail=900       # resend mail every __ seconds
timeout_mail=604800   # time out after this many seconds (default 7 days)
request="[type]"      # How to request a new tape (default "tty_email")
  request="tty"       # Use the tty to ask the user to change tape.
                      # Can't be use by cron
  request="email"     # Send an email to ask the user to change tape.
  request="tty_email" # Use the tty if it exist or send an email.
</programlisting>
</para>

</refsect2>

<refsect2><title>chg-zd-mtx</title>
<programlisting>
tpchanger "chg-zd-mtx"
changerdev "/dev/sg0"         # used with 'mtx -f'
changerfile "chg-zd-mtx.conf"
tapedev "tape:/dev/nst0"
</programlisting>

<para>This script interfaces with a tape drive using the Zubkoff/Dandelion
version of mtx.  That's the version that takes a device specifier with the
<command>-f</command> option and has subcommands like
<command>status</command>.  The configuration file parameters are (as listed in
the script itself):
<programlisting>
firstslot=?                 #### First storage slot (element)
lastslot=?                  #### Last storage slot (element)
cleanslot=-1                #### Slot with cleaner tape -- default is "-1"
                            #### Set negative to indicate no cleaner available
driveslot=0                 #### Drive slot number.  Defaults to 0
                            #### Use the 'Data Transfer Element' you want
autoclean=0                 #### Set to '1' or greater to enable
autocleancount=99           #### Number of access before a clean.
havereader=0                #### If you have a barcode reader, set to 1.
offline_before_unload=0     #### Does your robot require an
                            #### 'mt offline' before mtx unload?
poll_drive_ready=NN         #### Time (seconds) between tests to see if
                            #### the tape drive has gone ready (default: 3).
max_drive_wait=NN           #### Maximum time (seconds) to wait for the
                            #### tape drive to become ready (default: 120).
initial_poll_delay=NN       #### initial delay after load before polling for
                            #### readiness
slotinfofile=FILENAME       #### record slot information to this file, in
                            #### the line-based format "SLOT LABEL\n"
</programlisting>
</para>

</refsect2>

<refsect2><title>chg-rait</title>
<programlisting>
tpchanger "chg-rait"
changerfile "chg-rait.conf"
</programlisting>

<para>This changer script constructs RAIT devices out of the devices provided by several "sub-changers".  The configuration file specifies <computeroutput>nchangers</computeroutput>, the number of
subchangers, and then provides <computeroutput>tpchanger</computeroutput>, <computeroutput>changerdev_N</computeroutput>, <computeroutput>changerfile_N</computeroutput>, and <computeroutput>tpchanger_N</computeroutput> for each sub-changer, 1 through N.</para>

</refsect2>

<refsect2><title>chg-null</title>
<programlisting>
tpchanger "chg-null"
</programlisting>

<para>This changer always provides the device "null:".  It is sometimes useful in conjunction with <command>chg-rait</command>.</para>

</refsect2>

<refsect2><title>Unmaintained Changers</title>

<para>Amanda has many other changer scripts and programs beyond those described
here (see the <computeroutput>changer-src/</computeroutput> in the source
directory), but most of these scripts are unmaintained and undocumented, and
will be removed when the new changer API is fully implemented.</para>
