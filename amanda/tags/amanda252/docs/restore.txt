This document describes how to restore files backed up with Amanda either with
or without Amanda tools.
All these cases assume you're trying to restore a complete disk, that is,
you've replaced the lost disk with a new one, or created a new filesystem on
it. Tweaking with the arguments to restore (not amrestore), you will be able to
restore individual files.
Also, this text does not cover amrecover, a program that provides a text user
interface similar to interactive restore (restore -i), but it allows you to
select individual files to recover and automatically determines the tapes where
they were stored. The backups must be performed with the `index' option enabled
for this to work.
I considered the following cases.
The server machine (machine Aaron) runs solaris, the client machine (machine
Barney) runs sunos.

  1. Client machine fails, non-system critical.
     Example: /home fails on Barney.
     First, use amadmin to find the tapes most recently used to backup the
     partition.

       amadmin <config> info Barney '/home$'

       Current info for Barney /home:
         Stats: dump rates (kps), Full:   41.1,  33.1,  38.8
                           Incremental:    9.5,   2.1,  24.7
                 compressed size, Full:  63.1%, 54.0%, 52.9%
                           Incremental:  43.7%, 15.5%, 47.8%
         Dumps: lev datestmp  tape             file   origK   compK secs
                 0  19971223  Barney01           16  329947  208032 5060
                 1  19980108  Barney16            8    1977     864   91
                 2  19971222  Barney06            7    1874     672   83
                 3  19970926  Barney03           11   12273    3040  211

     This tells us that we will need two tapes to do a full restore (Barney01,
     Barney16). Note that, even if Barney06 and Barney03 are listed, they are
     actually older than the full backup, so they should not be used to restore
     any data.
     Log into Barney. Cd to the /home directory. Insert the tape with the level
     0 dump on it into the tape drive of Aaron.
     Become super-user in the client host and run (replace <amanda> with the
     username under which amanda runs):

       rsh -n -l <amanda> Aaron amrestore -p /dev/rmt/0cn Barney '/home\$' |
       restore -ivbf 2 -

     This requires client root to have login access to <amanda>@Aaron, with a
     .rhosts entry (.amandahosts won't do). If you use ssh, you may be able to
     type a password in order to be authenticated. Another alternative is to
     start the operation in the server, and rsh to the client. You should be
     the amanda user or root in the tape server and run:

       amrestore -p /dev/rmt/0cn Barney '/home$' |
       rsh Barney -l root /usr/etc/restore -ivbf 2 -

     If you don't want to use rsh at all, you may run:

       amrestore /dev/rmt/0cn Barney '/home$'

     This should create a file whose name contains the hostname, directory
     name, dump level and dump date of the backup. Now you have to move this
     file to the client somehow: you may use NFS, rcp, ftp, floppy disks :-),
     whatever. Suppose you rename that file to `home.0'. Then, on the client,
     you should become root and run:

       restore -ivbf 2 home.0

     Repeat one of these steps, incrementing the level of the dump, until there
     are no more available backups.
  2. Client machine fails, system critical disk.
     Example: / fails on Barney.
     First of all, boot off the CD, and reinstall the system critical
     partition, restoring it to vendor supplied state. Then, go through all of
     Scenario 1.
  3. Server machine fails, non-system critical, non-Amanda disk.
     Proceed just as described in Scenario 1. However, you won't have to go
     through the rsh process, because you can just use amrestore to replace the
     lost data directly.
  4. Server machine fails, system critical, non-Amanda disk.
     Example: / on Aaron
     First of all, boot off the CD, and reinstall the system critical
     partition, restoring it to vendor supplied state.
     Then, follow steps in Scenario 3.
  5. Server machine fails, non-system critical, Amanda disk, with db.
     Example: /opt on Aaron
     If the disk that contains the Amanda database is toast, then you need to
     rebuild the database. The easiest way to do it is to take the text file
     that you had mailed to you via the 'amadmin export' command, and import
     via the 'amadmin import' command. Then you should be able to follow the
     steps outlined in Scenario 4.
     Note that Amanda does not mail the exported database automatically; you
     may add this to the crontab entry that runs amanda.
     Maybe it's a good idea to print out the text files as well and store the
     last 2 dumpcycles worth of paper (the disc text files might have got
     toasted as well). From the paper you still are able to reconstruct where
     your discs are.
  6. Server machine fails, non-system critical, Amanda disk, with binaries.
     Example: /usr/local on Aaron
     This is where things get hairy. If the disk with the amanda binaries on it
     is toast, you have three options.

       i. reinstall the Amanda binaries from another tape, on which you have
          conveniently backed up the binaries within the last couple of weeks
          (not using Amanda).
      ii. recompile Amanda, making sure not to overwrite your db files.
     iii. use dd to read Amanda formatted tapes. This is the option I am going
          to explore most fully, because this seems the most likely to occur.

            a. Find out the device name used by Amanda, by looking in
               amanda.conf. Turns out to be /dev/rmt/0cn for this system.
               If amanda.conf isn't at hand: this must be a non-rewinding tape
               device specifier (which I believe the trailing `n' stands for).
            b. Look over the copy of the output of 'amadmin <config> export',
               and find out which tapes /usr/local was backed up on.
            c. Grab the tapes that /opt was backed up on, and stick the level 0
               into the drive. cd to /usr/local.
            d. Skip the first record, which is just the tape header, by using
               the appropriate tape command.

                 mt -f /dev/rmt/0cn fsf 1

            e. Now you want to start looking for /usr/local on this tape.

                 dd if=/dev/rmt/0cn bs=32k skip=1 | gzip -d | /usr/sbin/
                 ufsrestore -ivf -

               This command gives us an interactive restore of this record,
               including telling us what partition, what host, and what level
               the backup was. The gzip -d portion of the pipe can be omitted
               if there was no compression.
            f. If you don't find /usr/local on the first try, quit ufsrestore,
               and move forward one record.

                 mt -f /dev/rmt/0cn fsf 1

               and try the dd/restore command shown above. Do this until you
               find /opt on the disk.
               Another possibility: quick and dirty tape index in case you
               don't know which partition /usr/local was on: (from
               <ralf@atg.venture.de>)

                 #!/bin/sh
                 TAPEDEV=/dev/nrtape
                 while mt -f $TAPEDEV fsf 1 ; do
                   dd if=$TAPEDEV bs=32k count=1 | head -1
                   sleep 1
                 done

               Example output:

                 Amanda: FILE 19971220 uri /root-sun4 lev 1 comp .gz program
                 DUMP
                 Amanda: FILE 19971220 uri /misc lev 1 comp .gz program DUMP
                 Amanda: FILE 19971220 uri / lev 1 comp .gz program DUMP

            g. Restore the Amanda binaries (what else do you need??), and then
               bail out of ufsrestore. You can use amrestore, as in Scenario 3.
