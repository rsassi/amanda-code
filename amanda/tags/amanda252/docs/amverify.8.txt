Name

amverify  check an Amanda tape for errors

Synopsis

amverify config [ slot [runtapes]]

DESCRIPTION

Amverify reads an Amanda format tape and makes sure each backup image can be
processed by amrestore and, if possible, the appropriate restore program (e.g.
tar).
Amverify runs amrestore on each file of the tape and pipes the output to a
restore program (if available) with an option to create a catalogue of the
backup. The catalogue itself is discarded. Only the success or failure of the
operation itself is reported.
If the backup image cannot be processed by the restore program, e.g. if it was
written on a different operating system, the image is sent through dd to /dev/
null. This still determines if the tape is readable, but does not do any
internal consistency check on the image.
If config is set up to use a tape changer, the slot argument may be used to
choose the first tape to process. Otherwise, the current slot is used.
The runtapes configuration parameter determines how many tapes are processed
unless it is specified on the command line.
See the amanda(8) man page for more details about Amanda.
