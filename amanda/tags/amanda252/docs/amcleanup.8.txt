Name

amcleanup  run the Amanda cleanup process after a failure

Synopsis

amcleanup config

DESCRIPTION

Amcleanup generates the Amanda Mail Report and updates the Amanda databases
after a system failure on a tape server host. This cleanup process is normally
done automatically as part of the amdump program, but if amdump cannot complete
for some reason (usually because of a tape server host crash), amcleanup must
be run some time later (usually during system boot).
See the amanda(8) man page for more details about Amanda.

OPTIONS



  -k
      Kill all Amanda processes.


EXAMPLES

This example runs the Amanda cleanup process by hand after a failure.

  % amcleanup daily

Putting the following line in a system boot script (e.g. /etc/rc.local) runs
the Amanda cleanup process as part of the reboot, eliminating the need to run
it by hand.

  /usr/local/sbin/amcleanup daily

If nothing needs to be done, amcleanup exits normally with the message:

  amcleanup: no unprocessed logfile to clean up.
