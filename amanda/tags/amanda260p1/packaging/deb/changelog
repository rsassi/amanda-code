amanda (2.6.0p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial debian release: This package is based on Bdale Garbee's work as
    the official debian maintainer for amanda.
  * Found by Daniel_p: Fixed typos in preinst and postrm.  Added permission
    check for /tmp/amanda.  Fixed rules to append default perl site_lib to
    .install file so that perl modules are installed.
