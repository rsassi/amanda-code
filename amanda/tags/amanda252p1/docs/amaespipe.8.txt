Name

amaespipe  wrapper program for aespipe

Synopsis

amaespipe

DESCRIPTION

amaespipe requires aespipe, uuencode and gpg to work. Aespipe is available from
http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net
amaespipe will search for the aespipe program in the following directories: /
usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin.
amaespipe is called by amcrypt for Amanda data encryption.
amaespipe is based on aespipe's bzaespipe program. It calls aespipe to encrypt
data using AES256 as the encryption and SHA256 as the hash function. GPG key
should be stored in $AMANDA_HOME/.gnupg/am_key.gpg. amaespipe reads passphrase
from file descriptor 3. During decryption, amaespipe autodects encryption type
and hash function from the encrypted image.
