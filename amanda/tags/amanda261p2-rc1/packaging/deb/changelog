amanda (2.6.1p1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial debian release: This package is based on Bdale Garbee's work as
    the official debian maintainer for amanda.
  * Thanks to Jim Barber: Swap AMHOMEDIR for AMANDAHOMEDIR in postinstall,
    install .am_passphrase 0600, and add libglib2.0-dev to build-depends
