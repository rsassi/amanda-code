 * This contains the interface to the tape-scan algorithm implementation.
 * The interface is rather simple: Calling programs (taper, amcheck,
 * amtape) call the function below with a desired tape label, and get back
 * all the relevant label information, along with any other error messages.

/* taper_scan(): Scans the changer to find a tape to use. Reads the tape
 *               label, or invents a new one if label_new_tapes is in use.
 *               Note that the returned label information should not be
 *               re-read, because there may not actually exist a label
 *               on-tape (for WORM or newly-labeled media).
 *
 * Inputs: wantlabel
 * Outputs: Returns: -1 if an error occured or no tape was found.
 *                    1 if the most desirable tape was found.
 *                    2 if some other labeled tape was found.
 *                    3 if a brand new tape was found, which we should
 *                         label ASAP.
 *          gotlabel: What label was actually retrieved or invented.
 *         timestamp: What the timestamp string on-tape was. May be "X".
 *     error_message: Debugging output.
 *           tapedev: What device to use from now on.
 *
 * All returned strings are newly-allocated. */
