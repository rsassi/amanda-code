Name

amreport  generate a formatted output of statistics for an Amanda run

Synopsis

amreport [config] [-i] [-M address] [-l logfile] [-f outputfile] [-
p postscriptfile] [ -o configoption]...

DESCRIPTION

Amreport generates a summary report of an amanda(8) backup run. If no
configuration name is specified, amanda.conf is read from the current
directory.
See the amanda(8) man page for more details about Amanda.

OPTIONS



  config
      Name of the configuration to process.

  -i
      Don't email the report.

  -M address
      Mail the report to address instead of the mailto value from amanda.conf.

  -l logfile
      Name of the log file to parse to generate the report. If a log file is
      not specified, it defaults to the file:

logdir/log
where logdir is the log directory defined in amanda.conf.


  -f outputfile
      Normally, amreport sends the report via e-mail to the mailto user as
      defined in the amanda.conf file. If outputfile is specified, then the
      report is put in outputfile.

  -p postscriptfile
      Send the postscript output to the file postscriptfile instead of to the
      lpr(1) command. This option has an effect only if the lbl-templ directive
      is specified in amanda.conf.

  -o configoption
      See the "CONFIGURATION OVERRIDE" section in amanda(8).


LABEL PRINTING

Amanda can print postscript labels describing the contents of tape(s) written
in a run. The labels are designed to be folded and inserted into the tape case
along with the tape or hole punched and put in a 3-ring binder. Various label
templates are provided to format data for different tape sizes.
The information printed varies slightly between label templates due to size
constraints. Labels contain one line for each host/file-system pair and may
also contain the file number on the tape, the level of the dump, the original
size of the dump and the size of the (possibly compressed) tape file.
Add the lbl-templ parameter to the tapetype definition in amanda.conf to enable
labels. If you don't add this line to your tapetype definition, amreport will
not print tape labels.
You may use the remap='I'>printer keyword in amanda.conf to print to other than
the system default printer.

TEMPLATES

Amanda provides label templates for the following tape types. These are pretty
generic labels and should be easy to customize for other tape types or
particular site needs.

* ExaByte 8mm tapes
* DAT 4mm tapes
* DLT tapes
* 3-ring binder
The 3-ring binder type is the most generic. It may be used to make a hardcopy
log of the tapes.
