Name

amoverview  display file systems processed by Amanda over time

Synopsis

amoverview [[-config ] config ] [-hostwidth width] [-diskwidth width] [-
skipmissed] [-last] [-num0] [-togo0] [-verbose]

DESCRIPTION

Amoverview displays a chart showing hosts and file systems processed by Amanda
along with the backup level performed each day.
See the amanda(8) man page for more details about Amanda.

OPTIONS



  -config config
      Use configuration config instead of configuration daily.

  -hostwidth width
      Set host field column width to width characters instead of 8.

  -diskwidth width
      Set disk field column width to width characters instead of 20.

  -skipmissed
      Compacts the output by only printing stats for the days Amanda actually
      ran.

  -last
      Outputs the last status of each disk at the start. Useful for long
      tapecycles and/or sparse reports.

  -num0
      Outputs the number of level 0 dumps for each disk.

  -togo0
      Outputs the number of runs until the last level 0 dump is overwritten.

  -verbose
      Amoverview can take a long while on large systems. This option reports
      intermediate steps while it is working.


RESULTS

amoverview is a summary of the output of " amadmin <config> find ". When the
last column of amadmin find contains anything other than "OK", amoverview
translates this into "E" for that day.
A number indicates the level of backup and it succeeded. An "E" indicates an
error for that day. You get an "E" for all errors, like failed to connect,
datatimeout, computer crashed, etc, but also for failing to write to tape.
You can have an "E" followed by a number if a filesystem ran into end-of-tape
once (gives an "E", and later that day, you flush it to a second tape (a
number: the level, indicating success). If the flush failed too, you get a
double "EE" for that day.
You can also have a double code if you have two tapes in the changer and Amanda
failed to write to tape the first time because it hit end of tape (resulting in
"E0", for a full, "E1" for an incremental etc.) or twice with error ("EE"), and
may a successful flush afterwards giving maybe "EE0". (Only the latest 2
characters are printed).

EXAMPLE

This shows the /home file system on host2 was backed up at level 3 on the 8th,
9th and 10th of December, had a full backup on the 11th, a level 1 on the 12th
and a level 2 on the 13th.

  # amoverview
                           date 12 12 12 12 12 12
  host     disk                 08 09 10 11 12 13

  host1    /                     0  1  1  1  1  1
  host1    /var                  0  1  1  1  1  1
  host2    /                     1  1  1  1  1  0
  host2    /home                 3  3  3  0  1  2
  host2    /opt                  1  1  1  1  1  1
  host2    /var                  1  1  0  1  1  1
