Note

Refer to http://www.amanda.org/docs/howto-cygwin.html for the current version
of this document.
by Doug Kingston, 30 January 2003. Based on Cygwin 1.3.18, and Amanda 2.4.3-
20021027 and some fixes which will be in the official release by the time you
see this.
With thanks to Enrico Bernardini from whom I have borrowed some material from
an earlier attempt at documenting the installation of Amanda on Cygwin in 2001.
Please send annotations and corrections to mailto://amanda-hackers@amanda.org.
I can be reached as dpk (at) randomnotes.org (do the obvious).

 Install Cygwin

The following Cygwin packages are required for binary installation (may be
incomplete):

* Category BASE: standard
* Category MISC: gzip
* Category MISC: tar
* Category NET: inetutils

You need also these packages to build from source (may be incomplete):

* Category DEVELOP: ALL
* Category INTERPRETERS: m4, gawk ?
* Category LIBS:default selection? (libc, libiconv, others?)

I have most or the basic utilities and libraries installed so I cannot give you
a more specific list of what is required. If someone has a more definitive
list, I would appreciate and email to mailto://amanda-hackers@amanda.org.
One user reported some problems with access rights when running under Cygwin,
which he solved by setting the CYGWIN environment variable to nontsec. I do not
believe this is necessary if you run the Amanda daemon as System (see below).

 Other Preparation

When doing backups on a NT, Windows 2000 or Windows XP system, the choice of
user and group will be important if you are to properly interact with the
security mechanisms of these more modern Microsoft product. For Windows 95/98/
ME this is probably a non-issue. The most privileged account on the Windows
systems is 'System', and I have chosen to use this account for Amanda backups
to ensure that I can access the widest set of files. On Unix we would run as
root, with equivalent access permissions. I have also chose to run under the
'Administrators' group, another standard Windows group. Ensure these exist
before you continue - or identify another account to use. The Cygwin
installation postinstall script should have already populated /etc/passwd and
etc/group with these entries.

* Make sure that System (or SYSTEM) has a home directory specified in /etc/
  passwd.

I used _/home/root_. You'll need to put the file .amandahosts here later. The
relevant lines from my file /etc/passwd are:

  SYSTEM:*:18:18:,S-1-5-18:/home/root:
  root:*:18:18:,S-1-5-18:/home/root:


 Compile Amanda

After installing Cygwin, unpack the Amanda sources, typically in /usr/src/
Amanda or something similar. In the Amanda directory, you will need to execute:

  automake  # this may not be necessary in the official release
  autoconf  # this may not be necessary in the official release

  ./configure --without-server \
    --without-force-uid \
    --with-user=yourlogin \
    --with-group=Administrators
  make
  make       # yes, I needed to run it a second time
  make install

The use of your own login instead of SYSTEM requires some explanation. If you
were to call runconfigure with SYSTEM instead of your own login id as part of
the -with-user parameter, the installation process will fail due to the way
Cygwin and the NT/W2K/XP security system interact. Once you chown a file to
another user (like SYSTEM) you are no longer able to chgrp or chmod the file.
The installation process will abort at this point. By installing the files
owned by yourself, you will be able to chgrp and chmod them as expected. Note
that you still RUN as SYSTEM from /etc/inetd.conf (see below).

 Configure Cygwin files

You have to modify some config files:

* /etc/inetd.conf: cleanup un-needed entries: Comment out any entries you do
  not need by placing a '#' at the start of the lines. This is just good
  practice, and if any of the entries reference non- existent users (e.g. uucp)
  inetd may not start up.


* /etc/inetd.conf: add

               amanda dgram udp wait System /usr/local/libexec/amandad amandad

  ATTENTION: Use tabs, don't use spaces.


* create _/home/root/.amandahosts_ (or whereever System's home directory is):
  <amanda server> <amanda user>

Then create the following Amanda directories and the file amandates:

       mkdir -p /usr/local/var/amanda/gnutar-lists

       mkdir /tmp/amanda

       touch /etc/amandates


 Configure Windows System Files

Update the Windows services list

* WINDIR\Services: add

               amanda 	10080/udp	# Amanda backup services
               amandaidx 	10082/tcp	# Amanda backup services
               amidxtape 	10083/tcp	# Amanda backup services


where WINDIR is C:\WINNT\system32\drivers\etc or something similar. The last
two lines are needed if you want to use amrecover.
Ensure that the default Windows PATH environment variable include your Cygwin /
bin directory. This is necessary since inetd and hence the amandad that it
spawns will not have the advantage of being started by the standard bash shell
startup script and won't find the needed dynamic libraries (e.g. cygwin1.dll).
My PATH is:

  _%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;C:\cygwin\bin_

This is on XP; My Computer, right click Properties, click on Environment
Variables (at the bottom). Yours may vary, but make sure the Cygwin bin
directory is represented somewhere in the PATH.

 Configure inetd to run automatically as a service

If you want to test your installation, you can call inetd from bash prompt:

  /usr/sbin/inetd -d


 Windows 98/ME


* To start after the user logs in: Create a shortcut to c:
  \cygwin\usr\sbin\inetd.exe in WINDIR\start menu\programs\startup


* To start before the user logs in: Add the string key

    CygwinInetd=C:\cygwin\usr\sbin\inetd.exe

  under

    HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices

  in the registry. You'll see a dos-like window on the startup: I did not find
  a solution to iconize or to make invisible (suggestions are welcome).


 Windows NT/2000/XP

From bash prompt, type:

  /usr/sbin/inetd --install-as-service

Then, to start/stop the inetd service use the Services control panel or the
following Windows command:
net start/stop inetd

 Notes on Amanda backup options


 Compression

Currently, client side compression does not work, probably due to problems in
pipe emulation in Cygwin. I have not tried to debug this yet. This may be
addressed in a subsequent release, or it could be fixed in later releases of
Cygwin. Due to this issue, we recommend that if you want compressed dumps from
Windows clients, you configure Amanda for server compression in amanda.conf on
your Amanda server:

  define dumptype srv-comp-tar {
      global
      comment "partitions dumped via tar with server compression"
      program "GNUTAR"
      compress server fast
      exclude list ".Amanda.exclude"
  }


 Exclude Lists

A note on exclude lists is also in order. If you specify a relative path, it
will be expected that the file is in or relative to the root of the directory
you are planning to dump. Typically this will not be '/' but '/cygdrive/c' or
something similar if you want to get the Windows files and the Cygwin files. '/
' is taken to be the root of the Cygwin tree, normally something like C:
\cygwin or possibly C:\Program Files\cygwin.

 Debugging Files

Amanda will leave debugging files in /tmp/amanda if it exists. I have
recommended to create this directory above.
