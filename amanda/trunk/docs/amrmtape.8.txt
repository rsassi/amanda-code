Name

amrmtape  remove a tape from the Amanda database

Synopsis

amrmtape [-n ] [-v ] [-q ] [-d ] config label

DESCRIPTION

Amrmtape invalidates the contents of an existing backup tape in the
configuration database. This is meant as a recovery mechanism when a good
backup is damaged either by faulty hardware or user error, e.g. the tape is
eaten by the drive or is overwritten.
See the amanda(8) man page for more details about Amanda.

OPTIONS



  -n
      Generate new tapelist and database files with label removed, but leave
      them in /tmp and do not update the original copies.

  -v
      List backups of hosts and disks that are being discarded. Enabled by
      default.

  -q
      Opposite of -v.

  -d
      Run in debugging mode so all executed commands are shown.


EXAMPLE

Remove tape labeled DAILY034 from the DailySet1 configuration.

  # amrmtape DailySet1 DAILY034
