Name

ammt  Amanda version of mt

Synopsis

ammt [-d ] [ -f | -t | device ] command [count]

DESCRIPTION

Ammt provides just enough of the standard UNIX mt command for the needs of
Amanda. This is handy when doing a full restore and the standard mt program has
not yet been found.
Ammt also provides access to the Amanda output drivers that support various
tape simulations.
See the amanda(8) man page for more details about Amanda. See the OUTPUT
DRIVERS section of amanda(8) for more information on the Amanda output drivers.

OPTIONS



  -d
      Turn on debugging output.

  -fdevice
      Access tape device device. If not specified, the TAPE environment
      variable is used.

  -tdevice
      Same as -f.

  commandcount
      Which command to issue, and an optional count of operations.

  eof|weofcount
      Write count (default: 1) end of file marks (tapemarks).

      Skip forward count (default: 1) files.

  bsfcount
      Skip backward count (default: 1) files.

  asfcount
      Position to file number count (default: 0) where zero is beginning of
      tape. This is the same as a rewind followed by a fsf count.

  offline|rewoffl
      Rewind to beginning of tape and unload the tape from the drive.

        OFFLINE
            Indicates the drive is offline or not ready.

        ds
            Device status.

        er

        fileno
            Current tape file number.

        blkno

Many systems only report good data when a tape is in the drive and ready.
