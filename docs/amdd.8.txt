Name

amdd  Amanda version of dd

Synopsis

amdd [-d ] [if=input] [of=output] [bs=blocksize] [skip=count] [count=count]

DESCRIPTION

Amdd provides just enough of the standard UNIX dd command for the needs of
Amanda. This is handy when doing a full restore and the standard dd program has
not yet been found.
Amdd also provides access to the Amanda output drivers that support various
tape simulations. This may be used for debugging or to convert from one format
to another.
See the amanda(8) man page for more details about Amanda. See the OUTPUT
DRIVERS section of amanda(8) for more information on the Amanda output drivers.

OPTIONS



  -d
      Turn on debugging output.

  -llength
      Set the output length. If the output driver limits the output size, this
      controls when end of tape will be simulated.
      Length may have a multiplier suffix:

      k -> 1024 (Kilobytes)
      b -> 512 (Blocks)
      M -> 1024*1024 (Megabytes)
      The default is no multiplier (bytes).



  if=input
      Input to dd. Default is stdin.

  of=output
      Where to send the output of dd. Default is stdout.

  bs=blocksize
      Size of each record. Input records smaller than this will not be padded.
      Output records will be the same size as the corresponding input record.
      Default is 512 bytes.
      Blocksize may have a multiplier suffix:

      k -> 1024 (Kilobytes)
      b -> 512 (Blocks)
      M -> 1024*1024 (Megabytes)
      The default is no multiplier (bytes).



  count=count
      Number of records to copy. Default is all records until end of file.

  skip=count
      Number of records to skip before copying input to output. Default is
      zero.
