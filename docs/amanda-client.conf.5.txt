amanda-client.conf  Client configuration file for Amanda, the Advanced
Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver

DESCRIPTION

amanda-client.conf is the client configuration file for Amanda. This manpage
lists the relevant sections and parameters of this file for quick reference.

PARAMETERS

There are a number of configuration parameters that control the behavior of the
Amanda programs. All have default values, so you need not specify the parameter
in amanda-client.conf if the default is suitable.
Lines starting with # are ignored, as are blank lines. Comments may be placed
on a line with a directive by starting the comment with a #. The remainder of
the line is ignored.
Keywords are case insensitive, i.e. auth and Auth are treated the same.
Integer arguments may have one of the following (case insensitive) suffixes,
some of which have a multiplier effect:
